# FridgeTracker
Full Stack project to track items going into a fridge using image recognition software (in C++)
Contributors: John Carpenter, Nicolas Carpenter

Functionality To Implement:
- image recognition of foods (with text/recents option)
- database of common foods to keep track of shelf life
- online searches for recipes using foods that are about to go bad
- touchscreen interface with camera to put next to fridge (old laptop could work well or...)
- app for ios/android so that anyone can use the project, also does not require clunky laptop
  - personal profile showing most common foods, which foods you usually throw out
  - calorie tracking as an option? -> see myFitnessPal database?
  - notifications warning food is nearing end of shelf life
